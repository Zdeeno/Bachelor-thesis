This Bachelor's thesis aims at control of the solid-state lidar sensor with a limited number of steerable rays. Besides planning of directions of the rays, the thesis is also devoted to creating dense 3D maps from sparse measurements. The thesis uses deep neural networks for planning the rays and reconstructing the dense maps. Planning part exploits the reinforcement learning concept for training of the neural network. An environment implementing a framework for training of reinforcement learning agents was created. The agent proposed in this thesis is using stochastic methods to achieve a sufficient scalability in the challenging environment.
